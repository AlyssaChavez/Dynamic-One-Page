			<h1> My Current Plan </h1>
	
<p>I hope to one day live a life where I don't have to work for someone. I plan on becoming a freelance Graphic Designer and open up my own little business of designing various collateral pieces. I currently work as a Graphic Designer creating collateral, so I am gaining a lot of experience and knowledge. I will eventually start finding my own clients on sites like Upwork, because that will be my chance to start freelancing. When I graduate in Spring 2019, I will continue my education by getting various certificates. </p>

			<h1> A Piece of my Life </h1>
		
			<p>I married the love of my life on August 7, 2018. It felt a tad bit crazy because I am only 21, but I am so happy and exciting to see where our life and relationship takes us together!</p>
		<p>I am obsessed with dogs! My family has a total of 6 dogs at home, and I have my own German Shepherd Mix, Layla. I love to come home from a stressful day of work and give my dog tons of cuddles! I wouldn't trade her for the world!</p>
